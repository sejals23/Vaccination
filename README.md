# 🌍 Vaccination Data Analysis & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global vaccination data to understand patterns in coverage, reported cases, incidence rates, and vaccine introductions. Using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for data cleaning & preprocessing, **MySQL** for structured storage, and **Tableau** for visualization, the project highlights key insights into vaccination effectiveness and public health outcomes.

---

## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset is compiled from WHO vaccination reports and contains 5 main files:

1. **Coverage Data** – Vaccination coverage rates by country and antigen.  
2. **Incidence Rate Data** – Disease incidence rates over time.  
3. **Reported Cases Data** – Number of cases reported per disease and country.  
4. **Vaccine Introduction Data** – Year-wise introduction of vaccines across countries.  
5. **Vaccine Schedule Data** – Recommended immunization schedules for different vaccines.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, OpenPyXL, SQLAlchemy, PyMySQL)  
- **MySQL** (for storing cleaned datasets)  
- **Tableau** (for dashboards & visualizations)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for data preprocessing & analysis)

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning** → Handling missing values, normalizing units, and ensuring consistency.  
2. **Database Setup** → Creating normalized MySQL tables with referential integrity.  
3. **Data Insertion** → Exporting cleaned datasets into SQL tables.  
4. **Visualization** → Building dashboards in Tableau to answer key questions.

## 📈 Key Visualizations
- 🌍 **Global Vaccination Coverage (Heatmap)**  
- 📉 **Reported Cases vs Coverage (Scatter Plot)**  
- 📊 **Incidence Rate Comparison (Bar Chart)**  
- 📅 **Vaccine Introduction Timeline (Gantt Chart)**  
- 🧒 **Vaccine Schedule by Age (Heatmap)**  
- 🎯 **KPI Indicators (Dashboard Cards)**

---

## 🎯 Insights
- Countries with **>90% vaccination coverage** show significantly fewer disease cases.  
- Booster dose uptake has improved gradually over time.  
- Certain regions still show **high disease incidence despite high coverage**, indicating data quality or other health factors.  
- Vaccine introduction timelines vary significantly across WHO regions.
